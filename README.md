## How to use?
After installation, you are good to go. Nothing extra is needed.
Whenever you visit a page of intranet for provisional marks, Markify will append
calculated value to the header of that page *(shown in photo above)*

## Story
Interestingly, intranet already has this feature.
However, for some reason it is not used in the student interface.
